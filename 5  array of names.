Consider an array of names. We have to find out how many of these start with the letter “j” 
Create an automation where the number of names starting with “j” is counted and the result is 
displayed.

Steps:
1) Create a new project
2) create a variable
fisrt_letter  String mainsequence
arr_str String[] mainsequence
count1 Int32 mainsequence
3)  take assign activity 
in save to add arr_str variable  and value to save add {"Yashashri","Sujan","Sarvesh","Shweta","Riya"}
4) add for each activity in In add arr_str
5) In Body of for each activity add a assign activity in save to add first_letter and
value to save add currentText.ToString.SubString(0,1)
6) in body after assign activity add If activity in Condition add first_letter.ToLower.Equals("s")
in Then part of if activity add assign activity in save to add count1 and value to save add count1+1
7)  then in else loop drag and drop “continue activity”. 
8) Take message box activity inside the for each activity
"performed By 02_Yashahsri Gosavi" + vbCrLf + "Total No.Starting With Letter S: " +count1.ToString()
